The data set, as a flat rectangular CSV file, can be downloaded from
[here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/viparc/residues/master/data/last_week_antibiotics.csv):

```{r eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("readr")
last_week_antibiotics <- readr::read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/viparc/residues/master/data/last_week_antibiotics.csv",
                                         col_types = paste(c("c", rep("i", 47)), collapse = ""))
```

For each flock (row, as identified by `farm` and `flock`), it shows the duration,
in weeks, of the flock (`flock_duration`) as well as, for each antibiotic, the
number of weeks since last use at the end of the flock.
